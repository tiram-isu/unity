# unity-pong-keypoint-tracking
>This game is based on work form [Zigurous](https://www.youtube.com/@Zigurous) as seen in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcpaYq0ihaM&ab_channel=Zigurous).

We expanded on the base game by adding socket capabilities to receive keypoint-data from a client. Furthermore, we added some game logic to accommodate the new controls.

Features added:
- (local) multiplayer support
- keypoint-processing
- manual start button
- sound effects
- game-over screen

# Installation
